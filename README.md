# MOCTO Coding it Forward Exercise

Thank you so much for your interest in joining the MOCTO team! Please kindly go through this exercise and send your submissions over to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov

## Exercise Mechanics
Please accomplish this exercise before your scheduled interview. We will have a portion in the interview where we will be discussing your exercise submission.

Exercise is as follows:

1. We have sent you an invitation to access a github repository named at github.com/nyc-cto/coding-it-forward. Please clone this project and create a repository in your own github account with the name “MOCTO-CIF“ at the end of this exercise, we will ask you to send the link to that repository, we’d love it if you send it in the form `https://github.com/<your username>/mocto-cif`


2. The application is a bare bones login page. We would like you to make the page mock-functional. 
    * Create a next page that a user goes to after they "log in"
    * Only allow a user with username “mocto” and password “HelloCodingItForward!” to "log in"
    * Anyone else should be disallowed from going to the next page with some appropriate error message. 


3. We would love you to also accomplish any of the following:
    
    * Make it interactive. Create listeners to the textboxes and make sure an event and validation is fired when the person using the application clicks “Login.”
    * Make it user-centered. Add texts, design, or however you want to change the look and feel of the page.
    * Make it accessible. The page could still be navigable with a screen reader.
    * Make it responsive. The application looks correct on different screens and devices.
    * Make it multi-lingual. Allow for multiple languages to be used.
    * Automate deployment. Set up a CI/CD pipeline from your repository to some form of hosting service.

**Note: You don’t have to do all of the items we have mentioned. Pick only the one(s) you are most drawn towards** 

*Please do not spend more than 1-2 hours on this (you should not have enough time to complete all tasks)*

Once you’ve finished this exercise, please send your accomplished repository to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov with the subject “<Name> - MOCTO/CodingItForward Exercise” we will review this and will look forward to chatting with you about your work!
